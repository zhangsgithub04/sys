# Combinatorial Computing (Syllabus)

Have Fun!

## Course Description
Computational methods for discrete mathematical structures. Topics include representation of integers, sets, and graphs; counting and enumeration techniques; sorting and searching methods; and graph algorithms.

## Course Objectives and Outcomes
The objectives of the course are three-fold.
* Item The first goal is to review the fundamental concepts of combinatorics.  
* Item The second goal, also the primary goal, is to help students developing understanding of the classical computing algorithms that are involved in moderately difficult application problems where combinatorial patterns and behaviors dominate the complexities of the problem. 
Throughout the course, students will be trained to understand many seemingly complicated computing problems from a combinatorial approach and they are expected to discover combining rules and correspondingly decompose the problem into smaller manageable units. Students are expected to develop the ability to logically analyze the basic building blocks and combinatorial mechanisms behind the applications where combinatorial computing applications are involved.  
* Item The third goal of the course is to use the discussed combinatorial computing problems to challenge students to implement relevant classical algorithms thus improve studentsâ€™ programming skills and problem solving skills. Students will have an opportunity to practice the concepts and knowledge learned from the classes through hands-on programs and exercises.
 
At the end of this semester, each student who has successfully completed this class should demonstrate the solid understanding to the fundamentals of combinatorial computing and gain more confidence in writing moderately complicated programs to solve moderately difficult combinatorial problems. They will feel not only more comfortable in modeling various applications from the perspective of combinaotrics, but also more confident in programming the model. They should also be able to independently read more advanced source code which usually implements more advanced algorithms and use more advanced programming constructs from diverse resources and be able to modify and customize others' codes to solve new problems you may face in their futures. Successful completion of this course is helpful to computing research. They should be able to read research papers on the relevant concepts and topics.
